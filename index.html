          </h2>
          <p class="section-intro">
            This perspective is rooted in moral philosophy and the concept of
            distributive justice. It assumes as a fact that access to care is an
            essential precondition for a life worth living, Saying that health
            equity is something society must have, not just an extra benefit for
            individuals.

            </div>
            <p>
              Core Idea: Under conditions of perfect fairness (the Veil), any
              rational, self-interested individual would mandate universal, free
              healthcare. This is the Maximin Principle, maximizing the minimum
              well-being, ensuring that poverty or circumstance does not dictate
              survival.

            <p>
              Core Idea: Healthcare is a fundamental human right, not a market
              commodity. Treating healthcare as something only purchasable by
              those who can afford it creates inequality, long-term social harm,
              and preventable suffering. Universal access to healthcare is
              necessary for human dignity, social justice, and a healthy future
              population, since denying care—especially to children and the
              poor—undermines both individual well-being and society as a whole.

              Core Idea: Health is a foundational human capability, the freedom
              to achieve certain functionings. Illness is a fundamental
              unfreedom. State provision of health unlocks the potential for
              citizens to participate meaningfully in civic and economic life.

              physical health is a necessary prerequisite. Distributive justice
              demands essential goods be distributed based on need, not merit,
              wealth, or social status. Health must be prioritized over profit.

            This viewpoint is grounded in free-market economics and libertarian

              through competition, and respects the productive efforts of
              physicians and researchers, who are motivated by profit, not state

          argument is an appeal to efficiency. It focuses on the practical

        </h2>
        <div class="conclusion-box">
          <p class="conclusion-intro">
            The debate is not merely philosophical, but its an argument over
            logistics and societal models. The moral imperative to save lives
            clashes directly with the reality of finite resources and the
            economic imperative of innovation.
          </p>
          <p class="key-takeaway">
            The philosophical foundation for healthcare as a right is
            overwhelming (Rawls, Sen, Aristotle). Our ethical consensus,
            especially regarding basic life-saving procedures, demands equity.
            However, the Hayekian perspective provides a crucial check: the
            system designed to deliver this right must be economically viable,
            efficient, and respect the liberty of providers.
          </p>
          <div class="final-statement">
            We think the modern answer is a Hybrid Model: Basic, life-saving
            care is a guaranteed right, paid for by the collective.
            Discretionary or cosmetic procedures remain commodities, subject to
            market forces. This attempts to satisfy both moral duty and economic
            reality.
